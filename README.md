## 👋 Hi, I’m Andrea

Junior Data Analyst with strong **analytics engineering and applied ML** foundations.  
Currently completing an **MSc in Data Science** and building **end-to-end, production-style data and ML pipelines** using Python and SQL.

My background is in education (18 years), where I worked extensively with structured data, measurement, and stakeholder communication — skills I now apply to analytics and data engineering projects.
