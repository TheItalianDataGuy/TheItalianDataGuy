- ⚡ Fun fact: Transitioning from the education sector, I have long held a passion for tech and data. For this reason, I committed myself to pursuing my dream career in this field by obtaining a Master of Science in Data Science. With a strong background in communication, teamwork, and creative problem-solving, I have successfully completed projects that required coding and data analysis. In addition to this, I am relentlessly deepening my love for ML.
